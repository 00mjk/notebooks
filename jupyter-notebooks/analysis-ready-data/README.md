# Analysis Ready Data

The tutorials in this directory cover how to use the orders api to create Analysis Ready Data. These tutorials cover two use cases:
1. *As a software engineer at an ag-tech company, I'd like to be able to order Planet imagery programmatically in a way that enables the data scientist at my organization to create time-series algorithms (e.g. monitoring ndvi curves over time) without further data cleaning and processing.*

2. **NOTE: This may be outdated, update** *The second use case we will cover is: As a tropical forest monitoring analyst, I'd like to create an imagery pipeline that delivers analysis-ready imagery over a [LARGE] protected area so I can create simple change detection (ndvi_xdate - ndvi_ydate) analyses. I'd like to do minimal custom (non-Planet) data processing to get the imagery in a format that supports a change-detection analysis because my technical skills are limited.*

The first notebook, [ARD Best Practices and Use Case 1](ard_best_practices_and_use_case_1.ipynb), provides an introduction to Analysis Ready Data and the orders api, provides best practices for using the orders api, and runs through the first use case. The second notebook covers the second use case.
