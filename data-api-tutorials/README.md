## Using Python to access Planet's imagery

Hello and welcome! These notebooks are designed for users (like you!) who want to programmatically access Planet's imagery archive. We'll walk you through using Python to search, filter, and downland images via Planet's [Data API](https://api.planet.com/data/v1). If you'd like to start with a visual exploration of our stunning imagery, you can browse [Planet Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/) first, then circle back to these API-based guides.
