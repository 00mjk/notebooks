## Planet Interactive Guides

In this repository, you'll find a curated collection of Jupyter/IPython notebooks from the software developers, data scientists, and developer advocates at [Planet](https://www.planet.com/). These interactive, open-source (APLv2) guides are designed to help our users explore Planet's data archive, start using our APIs and tools, and learn more about extracting information from satellite imagery.

Soon we hope to add guides from the researchers, technologists, geographers, and entrepreneurs who are already using Planet data to ask interesting and innovative questions about our changing Earth. If you're working with our imagery and have a notebook (or just an idea for a notebook) that you'd like to share, please file an issue here or email [danabauer](https://github.com/danabauer) at <dana@planet.com>.
