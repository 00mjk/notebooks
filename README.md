## Planet Interactive Guides

In this repository, you'll find a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) from the software developers, data scientists, and developer advocates at [Planet](https://www.planet.com/). These interactive, open-source (APLv2) guides are designed to help our users explore Planet's data archive, start using our APIs and tools, and learn more about extracting information from Planet's massive archive of high-cadence satellite imagery.

### Developer tools
* [Introduction to Planet's Data API](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/blob/master/data-api-tutorials/planet_data_api_introduction.ipynb)
* [Using Planet's Python Client](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/blob/master/data-api-tutorials/planet_cli_introduction.pynb)

### Data processing
* [Creating a composite image from multiple PlanetScope scenes](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/blob/master/mosaicing/basic_compositing_demo.pynb)
* [Calculating a vegetation index from 4-band satellite imagery](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/blob/master/ndvi/ndvi_planetscope.pynb)

### Other notebooks from Planeteers
* [Python examples for remote sensing](https://github.com/kscottz/PythonFromSpace)
* [Exploring geospatial data with open source tools](https://github.com/kjordahl/SciPy-Tutorial-2015)

Soon we hope to add notebooks from the researchers, technologists, geographers, and entrepreneurs who are already using Planet data to ask interesting and innovative questions about our changing Earth. If you're working with our imagery and have a notebook (or just an idea for a notebook) that you'd like to share, please [file an issue](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/issues) or send a message to [danabauer](https://github.com/danabauer) at <dana@planet.com>.
